# audio_quality_checker

A tool to calculate the true bitrate of audio files

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Git**: For cloning the repository.
*   **Python 3**: For running the application and managing its dependencies.

### Setup and Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/edoadro/audio_quality_checker.git 
    cd audio_quality_checker
    ```

2.  **Make the start script executable:**
    This only needs to be done once after cloning.
    ```bash
    chmod +x start_app.sh
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    This script will automatically set up the virtual environment (if it doesn't exist), install dependencies, and launch the Streamlit application.
    ```bash
    ./start_app.sh
    ```

The application should then open in your web browser.
